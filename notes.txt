A. WITHOUT "allow-same-origin" 

    XHR is totally useless
    Tried CORS : fail
    Option A1 : Force developpers to use only JSONP             ---> GAVE UP
    
    Only communication is through window.postMessage 
    Option A2 : spoof XMLHttpRequest through window.postMessage ---> GAVE UP


B. WITH "allow-same-origin"

    TODO test cookie options
    TO CONSIDER localStorage/webworker/other-SOP-related unsafe


Actual state : full safe except for transmission of key.js
    CURRENT BEST OPTION - don't store in cookie, force use to input password everytime he enters, give key only against password



USEFULL : node modules are singleton = can be only 1 middleware for the developper
